### This repo is the Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning course Continue Control Project
> The README should be designed for a general audience that may not be familiar with the Nanodegree program; you should describe the environment that you solved, along with how to install the requirements before running the code in your repository.

##### Steps
1. install python
2. ```pip install pytorch``` reference [pytorch website](https://pytorch.org/)
3. ```pip install unityagents```
4. download **reacher env** from [Reacher_Linux](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux.zip)
5. Run ```components/env_tst.py``` to test the environment work all right.

##### Environments
